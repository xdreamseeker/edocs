# eDocs

eDocs is a WordPress theme that helps create and publish documents to make them digital by default.

##How it works

eDocs is designed for a [WordPress network](http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network) setup, where each site in the network represents a different document. 

Whether you're publishing a single page document or a detailed report, eDocs uses the WordPress page hierarchy and all the content you provide to build a book-like front-end website. It also combines [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) with the [MPDF](http://www.mpdf1.com/mpdf/index.php) library to generate and store PDF documents in the background using the same content.

It means your 'documents' are primarily consumed online, but also available to download, print and share offline.

The goal is to simplify document creation and management, whilst reducing the effort and cost that goes with design, print and distribution.

## Features

- **Repurpose** - write your content once and then distribute it in multiple formats
- **Collaborate** - setup multiple users in WordPress and assign them to one or more documents
- **Revision** - store any content changes with version control to enable comparison and rollback
- **Responsive** - eDocs is built with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) to optimise the layout across different devices
- **Customise** - upload cover pages, enable a table of contents and modify the design
- **Open source** - WordPress, the eDocs theme and MPDF are all free and open source

##Getting started

Once downloaded, unzip the compressed folder and upload the directory (and everything in it) to your `wp-content/themes` directory. Alternatively you can [upload the theme using WordPress](http://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Themes_Screen#Using_the_upload_method).
